# Mini Projects using Playright JS
This repository contains all mini projects that I wanted to create in Playwright JS.

Once you have the repository cloned, open a new terminal and run the command below:

`npm install`

The line above will download all of the dependencies you needed to start creating or updating tests.

I also would recommend reading the [Playwright Introduction](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to help you get started.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
